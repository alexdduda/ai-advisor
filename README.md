# Symbolos

A full-stack web application that helps McGill University students navigate course selection, track academic progress, and get personalized advice.

**Live at**: [ai-advisor-pi.vercel.app](https://ai-advisor-pi.vercel.app)

---

## What It Does

Students create a profile (major, year, GPA, interests) and then interact with the app through several core features:

**Proactive Advisor Cards** — AI-generated briefing cards that surface things the student needs to know: deadline warnings, prerequisite gaps, GPA insights, degree progress, and course recommendations. Students can also ask freeform questions that return as cards in their feed.

**Course Explorer** — Search McGill's course catalog with historical grade distributions (crowdsourced GPA averages per section/term), instructor info, and live RateMyProfessor ratings including quality, difficulty, and "would take again" percentages.

**Course Tracking** — Save courses to favorites, mark courses as completed (with grade and term), and flag current semester enrollments. This data feeds into the AI advisor's context for better recommendations.

**Academic Calendar** — A full calendar view with personal events, McGill academic dates, and auto-generated final exam entries based on your current courses. Supports configurable reminders via email or SMS.

**Bilingual Interface** — Full English/French language support across the entire UI.

**Theming** — Light, dark, and auto themes with a comprehensive CSS variable system built around McGill's brand colors.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Python 3.9+, Node.js 18+, a Supabase project, and an Anthropic API key.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
# Runs at http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

```bash
npm run dev
# Runs at http://localhost:5173
```

**Important**: The backend uses the Supabase **service role** key (full access). The frontend uses the **anon/public** key (restricted by RLS policies). Never expose the service key in client code.

## How the AI Context Works

When a student sends a chat message or requests advisor cards, the backend builds a rich context prompt that includes their full profile (major, minors, concentration, faculty, year, GPA, interests), all completed courses with grades, current enrollment, saved/bookmarked courses, upcoming calendar events, and advanced standing credits. This context is sent as a system prompt to Claude so every response is grounded in the student's actual academic situation.

The cards system uses a separate prompt that asks Claude to generate 3–6 high-value briefing cards categorized as deadlines, degree progress, course recommendations, grade insights, planning tips, or opportunities. Cards can also be generated from student questions via the "ask" endpoint.
