Students intending to apply for Honours should plan to complete as many of the specific requirements of their option as possible within the first two years. With the written approval of an adviser, up to 9 credits may be taken outside the Department. All Honours students must complete at least 6 of their complementary credits at the 500 level. Ideally, 500-level seminars chosen will be relevant to the area of the student's independent study in the Honours Essay course ( ENGL 491D1 Honours Essay. / ENGL 491D2 Honours Essay. ), taken without exception in the final year of the program. The Honours Essay is first planned in consultation with a supervisor at the time of application to the Honours program; it is then guided and evaluated by that supervisor during the completion of ENGL 491. Graduation with Honours requires 54 credits of English, a minimum mark of B+ on the Honours Essay, a minimum CGPA of 3.00, and a minimum program GPA of 3.50. Graduation with First Class Honours requires a mark of A on the Honours Essay, a minimum CGPA of 3.50, and a minimum program GPA of 3.70."

The program provides students with opportunities to explore the meaning and intersections of such categories as gender, race, class, sexual identification, age, ability, citizenship, and national identity, for example, and to examine how such categories might inform and reproduce power relationships. The Major Concentration consists of required GSFS courses that allow for an immersion into this area of study, and complementary courses from a range of departments, disciplines, and faculties. Students must see and adviser in Gender, Sexuality, Feminist, and Social Justice Studies at a minimum upon declaring the GSFS Major Concentration and prior to selecting courses for the final year of study."

The program enables students to explore the meanings and intersections of such categories as gender, race, class, sexual identification, age, ability, citizenship, and national identity, for example, and to examine how such categories might inform and reproduce power relationships. The Honours program culminates in the completion of an Honours thesis, supervised by a faculty member whose approval is sought the year prior. The Colloquium requires supplemental reading and writing assignments, training in research and thesis writing methods, presentation to the group of theses in progress, and response to the work of others. Honours students must maintain a program GPA of 3.30 and a CGPA of 3.00."

The B.A. Honours in Psychology (60 credits) is a specialized program that provides students with an in-depth overview of psychological science, covering the core areas as well as more advanced courses. Students are required to take a 2-term research course and seminar; students also have the option to complete additional research course(s) and/or gain additional training in arts related disciplines (see Program Requirements for details). This program emphasizes practice in the research techniques and statistics used in graduate school and professionally later on. It also provides students with the space to take the additional courses they may need for applying to graduate school in psychology and for completing the undergraduate credits in psychology as specified by the Ordre des Psychologues du Québec (which are required by some graduate psychology programs). Students must apply to the Honours program; admission is selective."

To be eligible to apply to the BA Honours in Psychology, students must have completed a minimum of 27 graded credits in the academic year prior to applying (fall and winter terms only). All applicants must have taken PSYC 204 Introduction to Psychological Statistics. , PSYC 211 Introductory Behavioural Neuroscience. , PSYC 212 Perception. , PSYC 213 Cognition. , PSYC 215 Social Psychology. and PSYC 305 Statistics for Experimental Design. . Exceptional performance in these courses is a primary criterion for acceptance into the Honours program. In addition to performance in these psychology courses, a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 3.50 is required to apply. However, since enrolment is limited, the typical CGPA cut-off is ~3.75, although this varies from year to year depending on the applicant pool. Once in the Honours program, students must obtain a GPA of 3.00 in the U2 year to continue in the Honours program for U3. Students are also encouraged to continue to complete a minimum of 27 graded credits in their U2 and U3 academic years. This is also the minimum number of credits required to be eligible for fellowships and awards."
